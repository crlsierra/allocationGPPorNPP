# Answers to copy-editor
- CE1: The change made during copy editing changed the meaning of the sentence. A correct form of this sentence is: "Together, these previous studies show that empirical work has promoted the implementation of Ra as a proportion of GPP, or based on some respiration paradigms, but they subtract Ra from GPP before carbon allocation occurs."
- CE2: Correction is correct.
- CE3: Correction is correct.
- CE4: This sentence lost its meaning after copy editing. It can be fixed by replacing 'predicting' for 'predicts'.
- CE5: Capitalization change is correct.
